              <p>The <a class="bold_link" href="http://snac-web.iath.virginia.edu">Prototype 
                History Research Tool</a> is an aggregate of biographical information about people, both 
                individuals and groups, who created or are documented in historical resources. Users can 
                search for names of individual people, organizations, and families; browse featured descriptions; 
                and discover and locate connected historical resources. Search results can be filtered by 
                occupation and subject.</p>
              <p>The Prototype History Research Tool foregrounds descriptions of the makers of history: 
                persons, organizations, and families, and links these descriptions to the distributed 
                historical resources that document their lives and work. The descriptions are biographical, 
                and through interrelations with one another, reveal the social, professional, and 
                intellectual networks within which the lives were lived. By linking the descriptions of the 
                persons, organizations, and families to descriptions of archival holdings distributed around 
                the world, the Prototype provides researchers with a tool that conveniently integrates access 
                to primary resources. </p>
              <p>With over 3.7 million descriptions, the prototype has achieved sufficient scale to be both 
                a useful reference source, and a means to locate millions of historical resources located in 
                more than 4,000 repositories around the world. </p>

                <p>The number of persons, organizations, and families described in the prototype will continue to grow 
              throughout the remainder of the SNAC R&amp;D project (ending March 31, 2015), and it is estimated the 
              total number of descriptions may exceed 3.5 million.</p-->
