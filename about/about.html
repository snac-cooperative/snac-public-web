                    SNAC is demonstrating the feasibility of separating the description of persons, families, 
                    and organizations&mdash;including their socio-historical contexts&mdash;from the description of the 
                    historical resources that are the primary evidence of their lives and work. A key objective 
                    is to provide researchers with convenient, integrated access to historical collections held 
                    by multiple private and public archives and libraries around the world while also setting 
                    the stage for a cooperative program for maintaining information about the people documented 
                    in the collections.</p>

                    SNAC is pleased to announce the launch of the Social Networks and Archival Context Cooperative, 
                    hosted by the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The Cooperative 
                    will enable archivists, librarians, and scholars to jointly maintain information about the people 
                    documented in archival collections. It will also improve the economy and quality of archival 
                    processing and description, and address the challenge of discovering, locating, and using 
                    distributed historical records.</p>

              <h3>Addressing a Longstanding Research Challenge</h3>
              <p>SNAC is addressing a longstanding research challenge: discovering, locating, and using 
              distributed historical records. Scholars use these records as primary evidence for 
              understanding the lives and work of historical persons and the events in which they 
              participated. These records are held in archives and manuscript libraries, large and 
              small, around the world. Scholars may need to search scores of different archives one 
              by one, following clues, hunches, and leads to find the records relevant to their topic. 
              Furthermore, descriptive practices may differ from one archive or library to another. 
              The research is time consuming and inefficient: clues and leads may be easily overlooked 
              and important resources undiscovered. </p>
              
              <p>The data needed to address this research challenge already exists in the guides, 
              catalogs, and finding aids that archivists and librarians create to document and provide 
              access to the archival resourcess. It is buried in isolated guides and finding aids that 
              are stored in different, isolated systems. </p>
              
              <h3>Establishing a Framework: Phase 1</h3>
              <p>In 2010, with funding from the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities, SNAC began to 
              explore the feasibility of extracting the data in the record descriptions that describes 
              the people who created or are documented in the records. This data was then assembled into 
              a collection of descriptions of individuals, families, and organizations that are 
              interrelated with one another and with the resources that document their lives. The 
              collection of records was then used to build a prototype research tool that 1) integrates 
              and simplifies access to the dispersed resources and 2) provides unprecedented access to 
              the biographical-historical contexts of the people documented in the resources, including 
              the social-professional-intellectual networks within which they lived.</p>
              
              <p>It quickly became apparent to the SNAC team that, while it was quite feasible to extract 
              the data and use it to build a research tool, computational techniques alone would not 
              fully realize the potential power of the assembled data to both transform research and 
              improve the economy and effectiveness of archival descriptive practices. To fully realize 
              these complementary objectives, it would be necessary to develop an ongoing, sustainable 
              international cooperative that would enable archivists, librarians, scholars, and, eventually, 
              &ldquo;citizen archivists&rdquo; to maintain and add biographical-historical data and to extend the scope 
              of the people and historical resources covered.</p>
              
              <h3>Establishing a Framework: Phase 2</h3>
              <p>With additional funding from the U.S. Institute for Museum and Library Services and the 
              Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, SNAC continues its research and development work, increasing the 
              quantity and diversity of the sources data and improving the technical methods. The team is in 
              the planning phase of transforming this research into an international cooperative hosted by 
              the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
